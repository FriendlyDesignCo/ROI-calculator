<h2>Advertising Cost</h2>

According to one survey, the average U.S. company spends $3,500 per new hire in job advertising costs and human resources staff, or $124 billion per year.</p>
<p>That figure includes at least some part of human resource staff salaries and comes from Karen O’Leonard, “The Talent Acquisition Factbook 2011” (Oakland, CA: Bersin & Associates, 2011). Estimates from the United Kingdom are comparable at about $2,700 per hire for entry-level college graduates; CFE Research, “The AGR Graduate Recruitment Survey 2013” (Leicester, U.K., 2013).</em></p>
